Day 1: Java Fundamentals & Core Concepts
Review OOP concepts: Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction.
Understand Java Collections Framework: Lists, Sets, Maps, Stacks, Queues.
Practice basic Java syntax: Loops, conditionals, functions, exception handling.
Platforms: Java Docs, W3Schools, or GeeksforGeeks (Java basics).


Day 2: Data Structures
Study and implement:
Arrays and Strings (common manipulation techniques).
Linked Lists (single, double).
Stacks and Queues (use cases and implementations).
Solve related problems on LeetCode or HackerRank.

Day 3: Algorithms - Sorting & Searching
Understand and implement:
Sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge Sort, Quick Sort.
Binary Search and variations.
Solve algorithm challenges focusing on sorting/searching.


Day 4: Recursion, Backtracking, and Dynamic Programming
Practice recursion and basic backtracking problems.
Learn fundamental Dynamic Programming concepts: memoization, tabulation.
Solve problems like Fibonacci, Subset Sum, and Knapsack.

Day 5: Problem-Solving Practice (Mixed Difficulty)
Solve 6â€“8 problems of varying difficulty on LeetCode/CodeSignal focusing on:
Arrays & Strings
HashMaps/Sets
Trees/Graphs (basic traversal: BFS, DFS)
Recursion/DP

Day 6: Mock Interview & Review
Take a full-length mock interview (1.5 hours) using platforms like Pramp or Interviewing.io.
Review previous problems and note patterns in solutions.
Brush up on Java-specific syntax and common pitfalls.
